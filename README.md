# Harry's Custom ALEXNDR DevBase Creator for SM-G960F

Hello, since more and more devs decided to abandon the S9, I decided I need my personal means to create a flashable zip based on the 
latest Samsung Stock Firmware.

As base i use https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s9/samsung-galaxy-s9--s9-cross-device-development/rom-u1arc5-devbase-v5-2-t3764822
by ALEXNDR.

Usage:
    1. Clone or Download Repository
    2. Download Samsung Stock Firmware
    3. Extract .tar.md5 files to "SOURCE"-Folder
    4. Run "All.bat"
 
 I tested this only for the S9 (SM-G960F), but it might also work for the S9+.
